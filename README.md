Research for estimating intra-operative pain

Estimating pain during surgery via vital signs is very important since anethesiologists control the level of propofol-remifentanil via pain. There are some indices made to represent the pain score, but there are limitations to be used in OR. 
So the purpose of the research is to develop the pain index using deep learning model to precisely estimate intraoperative pain.

In this research, we used open dataset from [vitalDB](https://vitaldb.net/dataset).
